```python
# Define two sets
E = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}  # Even numbers
N = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}  # Natural numbers

# Perform set operations
union_set = E | N
intersection_set = E & N
difference_set = E - N
symmetric_difference_set = E ^ N

# Display results
print(f"Union of E and N is {union_set}")
print(f"Intersection of E and N is {intersection_set}")
print(f"Difference of E and N is {difference_set}")
print(f"Symmetric difference of E and N is {symmetric_difference_set}")
